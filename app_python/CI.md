# Best practices:

## Clear Structure and Organization
The workflow is logically divided into jobs: build-docker, test, and security, making it easy to identify the purpose of each section.

## Use of Secrets
Docker Hub and Snyk credentials are securely managed using GitHub secrets.

## Caching Dependencies
A caching strategy is implemented using actions/cache@v4 to speed up the installation of Python dependencies. 

## Linting and Testing
Steps are included for linting code with flake8 and running tests with pytest. 

### Snyk Security Checks
- The workflow includes security checks using Snyk, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified early in the integration process.
